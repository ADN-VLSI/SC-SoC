# Clock Divider Documentation

## Overview

A clock divider is a digital circuit that reduces the frequency of an input clock signal. It is widely used in digital systems to generate slower clock signals from a faster reference clock. This documentation describes the design, operation, and usage of a configurable clock divider module as depicted in the provided schematic.

## Functional Description

The clock divider generates an output clock (`clk_o`) whose frequency is a divided version of the input clock (`clk_i`). The division factor is set by the `div_i` input. The module supports asynchronous reset via `arst_ni`.

### Corner cases:

- If `div_i` is set to 0, the clock is actually divided by 1 (no division).

### Key Features

- **Configurable Division**: The division ratio is set by `div_i`
- **Dual-Edge Operation**: The design uses both rising and falling edges of the input clock for improved duty cycle accuracy (see schematic).
- **Asynchronous Reset**: The output and internal state are reset when `arst_ni` is low.

## Block Diagram

Refer to the attached schematic (`clk_div.svg`).

<img src="./clk_div.svg">

```sv
always_comb begin : counter_logic
  div = (div_i == 0) ? 1 : div_i; // Handle zero division case
  cnt_next = (cnt == div - 1) ? 0 : cnt + 1; // Counter logic for division
end
```

- The design uses two D flip-flops and multiplexers to achieve dual-edge clock division.
- The division logic is controlled by the value of `div_i`,
- The output clock is generated by combining the outputs of the two flip-flops.

## Operation

1. **Reset**: When `arst_ni` is low, all internal registers and the output are reset.
2. **Division**: On each edge of `clk_i`, the internal counter increments. When the counter reaches the value set by `div_i`, the output clock toggles and the counter resets.
3. **Output**: The `clk_o` output toggles at a frequency of `clk_i / (2 * div_i)` (for even division factors). For odd division factors, the duty cycle may not be exactly 50%.

## Typical Applications

- Generating lower-frequency clocks for subsystems
- Baud rate generation in UARTs
- Power management (slower clocks for low-power modes)
